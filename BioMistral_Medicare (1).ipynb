Extra Help—a program that helps cover your Part D drug costs—expanded to cover more drug costs for certain people with limited resources and income. Go to pages 83  and 92. \\nCoinsurance amounts for some Part B-covered drugs may be less if a prescription drug’s price increased higher than the rate of inflation. Go to page 40.\\nLower costs for insulin and vaccines \\nYour Medicare drug plan can't charge you more than $35 for a one-month supply of each insulin product Part D covers, and you don’t have to pay a deductible for it. Go to page 88 .\\nIf you take insulin through a traditional pump that’s covered under Medicare’s durable medical equipment benefit, that insulin is covered under Medicare Part B. You won’t pay more than $35 for a month’s supply and the Medicare deductible no longer applies. Go to pages 39  and 88.\\nRecommended adult vaccines are also now available at no cost to you. Go to page 50.\\nChanges to telehealth coverage\\nYou can still get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home, until the end of 2024. After that, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area to get most telehealth services. There are some exceptions, like for mental health services. Go to page 51 . \\nManaging and treating chronic pain \\nMedicare now covers monthly services to treat chronic pain if you’ve been living with it for more than 3 months. Go to page 34 . \\nBetter mental health care\\nMedicare now covers intensive outpatient program services provided by hospitals, community mental health centers, and other locations if you need mental health care. Go to pages 46–47 .\\nMore times to sign up for Medicare\\nIf you recently lost (or will soon lose) Medicaid, you may be able to sign up for Medicare or change your current Medicare coverage. There are other special situations that allow you to sign up for Medicare. Go to page 18 .\\nCOVID-19 care \\nMedicare continues to cover the COVID-19 vaccine, and several tests and treatments to keep you and others safe.

Some plans may have a \\n$0 premium and may help pay all or part of your Part B premium.

SECTION 4  \\nMedicare Advantage \\nPlans & other options\\nWhat are Medicare Advantage Plans?\\nA Medicare Advantage Plan is another way to get your Medicare Part A \\nand Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called “Part C” or “MA Plans,” are Medicare-approved plans offered by private companies  that must follow rules set by Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans include drug coverage (Part D). In many cases, you’ll need to use health care providers who participate in the plan’s network. These plans set a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket each year for covered services. Some plans offer non-emergency coverage out of network, but typically at a higher cost. In many cases, you may need to get approval, also called prior authorization, from your plan before it covers certain drugs or services. \\nRemember, you must use the card from your Medicare Advantage Plan to \\nget your Medicare-covered services. Keep your red, white, and blue Medicare card in a safe place because you might need it later. \\nIf you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you’ll still have Medicare but you’ll \\nget most of your Part A and Part B coverage from your Medicare Advantage Plan, not Original Medicare. \\nWhat are the different types of Medicare Advantage Plans? \\n• Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plan:  Go to page 66 . \\n• HMO Point-of-Service (HMOPOS) Plan:  This HMO plan may allow you to \\nget some services out of network for a higher copayment  or coinsurance . \\nGo to page 66 .\\n• Medical Savings Account ( MSA) Plans: Go to page 67 .\\n• Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan: Go to page 68 . \\n• Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) Plan:  Go to page 69. \\n• Special Needs Plan (SNP): Go to page 70 . \\nWhat do Medicare Advantage Plans cover? \\nMedicare Advantage Plans provide all of your Part A and Part B benefits, except for  certain costs of clinical trials (clinical research studies), hospice \\ncare, the cost of getting a kidney transplant (like expenses for a living kidney donor), and, for a temporary time, some new benefits that come from legislation or national coverage determinations.

Plans can also choose to cover even more benefits. For example, some plans may offer coverage for services like transportation to doctor visits, over-the-counter drugs that Part D doesn’t cover, and other health care services. Check with the plan before you join to find out what benefits it offers, and if there are any limitations.\\nPlans can also tailor their benefit packages to offer additional benefits \\nto certain chronically-ill enrollees. These packages will provide benefits customized to treat specific conditions. Although you can check with a Medicare Advantage Plan before you join to find out if they offer these benefit packages, you’ll need to wait until you join the plan to find out if you qualify. \\nGet the most out of your dental benefitsIf you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan, take charge of your oral health, and contact your plan to learn more about dental services that it may cover and what limitations may apply. \\nMedicare Advantage Plans must follow Medicare’s rules \\nMedicare pays a fixed amount for your coverage each month to the companies offering Medicare Advantage Plans. These companies must follow rules set by Medicare. However, each Medicare Advantage Plan can charge different out-of-pocket costs and have different rules for how you get services (like whether you need a referral  to use a specialist or if you have to go to doctors, \\nfacilities, or suppliers that belong to the plan’s network for non-emergency or non-urgent care). These rules can change each year. The plan must notify you about any changes before the start of the next enrollment year. \\nRemember, you have the option each year to keep your current plan, choose \\na different plan, or switch to Original Medicare. Go to page 71 . \\nProviders can join or leave a plan’s provider network any time during the year. Your plan can also change the providers in the network any time during the year. If this happens, you usually won’t be able to change plans but you can choose a new provider. You generally can’t change plans during the year.\\nEven though the network of providers may change during the year, the plan \\nmust still give you access to qualified doctors and specialists. Your plan will notify you that your provider is leaving your plan so you have time to choose a new one. You’ll get this notice if it’s a primary care or behavioral health provider and you have gone to that provider in the past three years. If any of your other providers leave your plan, you’ll get this notice in certain situations. \\nYour plan will also: \\n• Help you choose a new provider to continue managing your health care \\nneeds.\\n• Help you continue needed care that’s already in progress.\\n• Notify you about the different enrollment periods available to you and options you may have for changing plans.\\nNew!', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Medicare/Medicare.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

SECTION 5  \\nMedicare Supplement \\nInsurance (Medigap) \\nHow does Medigap work?\\nOriginal Medicare doesn’t pay all of the cost for covered health care services \\nand supplies. Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ) policies sold by \\nprivate insurance companies can help pay some of the remaining health care costs for covered services and supplies, like copayments , coinsurance , and \\ndeductibles . \\nSome Medigap policies also offer coverage for services that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, like medical care when you travel outside the U.S. Generally, Medigap doesn’t cover long-term care (like care in a nursing home), vision or dental services, hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private-duty \\nnursing.\\nMedigap plans are standardized \\nMedigap must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and they must be clearly identified as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.” Insurance companies can sell you only a “standardized” plan, identified in most states as plans A–D, F, G, and K–N. All plans offer the same basic benefits, no matter where you live or which insurance company you buy the policy from. Some offer additional benefits. Compare the benefits of each lettered plan to help you find one that meets your needs. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Medigap plans are standardized in a different way. For more information or to find Medigap policies in your area, visit\\n Medicare.gov/medigap-supplemental-insurance-plans . \\nYou can also visit Medicare.gov/publications  to review the booklet, \\n“Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare.”\\nMedigap plans sold to people who are new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020 aren’t allowed to cover the Part B deductible. Because of this, Plans C and F are no longer available to people new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. However, if you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but haven't yet enrolled, you may be able to buy Plan C or Plan F.

With Medigap, you pay a monthly premium  \\nto a private insurance company in addition to the monthly Part B premium \\nyou pay to Medicare. If you're thinking about buying Medigap, be sure to compare plans. The costs can vary between plans offered by different companies for exactly the same coverage, and may go up as you get older. Some states limit Medigap premium costs. A Medigap policy only covers one person. Spouses must buy separate coverage. \\nCan I buy Medigap and a separate Medicare drug plan from the same \\ncompany? \\nYes. But you may need to make 2 separate premium payments. Contact the company to find out how to pay your premiums. \\nCan I have drug coverage in both Medigap and my Medicare drug plan?\\nNo. Go to page 89 for more information.\\nNote: In some states, you may be able to buy another type of Medigap policy \\ncalled Medicare SELECT. Medicare SELECT is a type of Medigap policy sold in some states that requires you to use hospitals and, in some cases, doctors within its network to be eligible for full insurance benefits (except in an emergency). If you buy Medicare SELECT, you have rights to change your mind within 12 months and switch to standard Medigap.\\nWhen's the best time to buy a Medigap policy? \\n• The best time to buy a Medigap policy is during your Medigap Open \\nEnrollment Period. This 6-month period begins the first month you have Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), and you’re 65 or older. (Some \\nstates have additional Open Enrollment Periods.) After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy a Medigap policy or it may cost more. In certain situations, you may have rights to buy a Medigap policy (guaranteed issue rights) outside of your Medigap Open Enrollment Period. \\n• If you delay signing up for Part B because you have group health coverage based on your (or your spouse’s) current employment, your Medigap Open Enrollment Period won’t start until you sign up for Part B. \\n• Federal law generally doesn’t require insurance companies to sell Medigap to people under 65. If you’re under 65, you might not be able to buy the policy you want, or any policy, until you turn 65.

              " Document(page_content='SECTION 6:  Medicare drug coverage (Part D)84\\nThere are 3 ways to avoid paying a penalty: \\n1. Get Medicare drug coverage (Part D) when you’re first eligible for it. Even \\nif you don’t take drugs now, you should consider joining a separate Medicare drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage to avoid a penalty. You may be able to find a plan that meets your needs with little to no monthly premiums. Go to pages 10–14 to learn more about your choices. \\n2. Add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) if you lose other creditable coverage. Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. Your plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later. \\n3. Keep records showing when you had other creditable prescription drug coverage, and tell your plan when they ask about it. If you don’t tell your plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage. \\nHow much more will I pay for a late enrollment penalty? The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you didn’t have creditable prescription drug coverage. Currently, the late enrollment penalty is calculated by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium”  ($34.70 in 2024) by the number of full, uncovered months that you were eligible but didn’t have Medicare drug coverage (Part D) and went without other creditable prescription drug coverage. The final amount is rounded to the nearest $.10 and added to your monthly premium . The “national base \\nbeneficiary premium” may increase or decrease each year. If that occurs, the penalty amount may also increase or decrease. After you get Medicare drug coverage, the plan will tell you if you owe a penalty and what your premium will be. \\nExample: Mrs. Martinez is currently eligible for Medicare, and her Initial Enrollment \\nPeriod ended on May 31, 2020. She doesn’t have prescription drug coverage from any other source. She didn’t join by May 31, 2020, and instead joined during the Open Enrollment Period that ended December 7, 2022. Her drug coverage was effective January 1, 2023.\\n2023\\nSince Mrs. Martinez was without creditable prescription drug coverage from June 2020–December 2022, her penalty in 2023 was 31% (1% for each of the  \\n31 months) of $32.74 (the national base beneficiary premium for 2023) or $10.14. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, she paid $10.10 each month in addition to her plan’s monthly premium.\\nHere’s the math:.31 (31% penalty) × $32.74  (2023 base beneficiary premium) = $10.14\\n$10.14 rounded to the nearest $0.10 = $10.10\\n$10.10 = Mrs. Martinez’s monthly late enrollment penalty for 2023', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Medicare/Medicare.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",

So, Mrs. Martinez’s new monthly \\npenalty in 2024 is 31% of $34.70, or $10.75 each month. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, she pays $10.80 each month in addition to her plan’s monthly premium.\\nHere’s the math:.31 (31% penalty) × $34.70 (2024 base beneficiary premium) = $10.75\\n$10.75  rounded to the nearest $0.10 = $10.80\\n$10.80 = Mrs. Martinez’s monthly late enrollment penalty for 2024\\nWhat if I don’t agree with the late enrollment penalty? \\nYour Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage will send you a letter stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. If you disagree with your penalty, you can request a review (generally within 60 days from the date on the letter). Fill out the “reconsideration request form” you get with your letter by the date listed in the letter. You can provide proof that supports your case, like information about previous creditable prescription drug coverage . If you need help, call your plan. \\nWhich drugs are covered?\\nAll plans must cover a wide range of prescription drugs that people with Medicare take, including most drugs in certain “protected classes,” like drugs to treat cancer or HIV/AIDS. Information about a plan’s list of covered drugs (called a “ formulary ”) isn’t included in this handbook because each plan \\nhas its own formulary. A plan can make some changes to its drug list during the year if it follows guidelines set by Medicare. For example, your plan may change its drug list during the year because drug therapies change, new drugs are released, or new medical information becomes available. Your plan coinsurance  may increase for a particular brand name drug or generic drug \\nwhen the manufacturer raises the price. Your copayment  or coinsurance may \\nincrease when a plan starts to offer a generic form of a brand name drug, but you continue to take the brand name drug. In some cases, the plan may cover a drug for one health condition but not another.\\nNote: Medicare Part B covers a limited number of outpatient prescription \\ndrugs. Go to page 39  for more information.\\nYour Medicare drug coverage (Part D) typically places drugs into different levels called “tiers” on their formularies. Drugs in each tier have a different cost. For example, a drug in a lower tier will generally cost you less than a drug in a higher tier. \\nWhat happens if my drug is in a higher tier? \\nIn some cases, if your drug is in a higher tier and your prescriber (your doctor or other health care provider who’s legally allowed to write prescriptions) thinks you need that drug instead of a similar drug in a lower tier, you or your prescriber can ask your plan for an exception to get a lower coinsurance or copayment for the drug in the higher tier.

Go to page 106 . \\nPlans may have coverage rules for certain drugs \\n• Prior authorization:  You and/or your prescriber must contact your plan \\nbefore you can fill certain prescriptions. Your prescriber may need to show that the drug is medically necessary  for the plan to cover it. \\nPlans may also use prior authorization when they cover a drug for only certain medical conditions it’s approved for, but not others. When this occurs, plans will likely have alternative drugs on their list of covered drugs (formulary ) for the other medical conditions the drug is approved to treat. \\n• Quantity limits:  Limits on how much medicine you can get at a time. \\n• Step therapy:  You may need to try one or more similar, lower-cost drugs \\nbefore the plan will cover the prescribed drug. \\n• Medication safety checks at the pharmacy: Before the pharmacy fills your prescriptions, your plan and pharmacy perform additional safety checks, like checking for drug interactions and incorrect dosages. \\n These safety checks also include checking for possible unsafe amounts \\nof opioid pain medications, limiting the day’s supply of a first prescription for opioids, and use of opioids at the same time as benzodiazepines (commonly used for anxiety and sleep). Opioid pain medicine (like oxycodone and hydrocodone) can help with certain types of pain, but have risks and side effects (like addiction, overdose, and death). These can increase when you take opioids with certain other drugs, like benzodiazepines, anti-seizure medications, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, certain antidepressants, and drugs for sleeping problems. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about risks or side effects.\\n• Drug Management Programs: Medicare drug coverage (Part D) has \\nprograms in place to help you use these opioids and benzodiazepines safely. If your opioid use could be unsafe (for example, due to getting opioid prescriptions from multiple doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent overdose from opioids), your plan will contact the doctors who prescribed them for you to make sure they’re medically necessary and you’re using them appropriately.Important!', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Medicare/Medicare.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

Talk with your doctor about having naloxone at home.\\n• Talk with your doctor about your dosage and the length of time you’ll be taking opioids. You and your doctor may decide later you don’t need to take all of your prescription.\\n• Talk with your doctor about other options that Medicare covers to treat your pain, like non-opioid medications and devices, physical therapy, acupuncture for lower back pain, individual and group psychotherapy, behavioral health integration services, and more. \\n• Never take more opioids than prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about any other pain medicines you’re taking.\\n• Safely store and discard unused prescription opioids through your community drug take-back program or your pharmacy mail-back program.\\nFor more information on safe and effective pain management and opioid use, visit Medicare.gov/coverage/pain-management  or call \\n1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).

For example, you can appeal if Medicare or your plan denies: \\n• A request for a health care service, supply, item, or drug you think Medicare should cover. \\n• A request for payment of a health care service, supply, item, or drug you already got. \\n• A request to change the amount you must pay for a health care service, supply, item, or drug. \\nYou can also appeal:\\n• If Medicare or your plan stops providing or paying for all or part of a health care service, supply, item, or drug you think you still need.\\n• An at-risk determination made under a Drug Management Program that limits access to coverage for frequently abused drugs, like opioids and benzodiazepines. Go to page 86 .\\n• If your claim is denied because of an open accident record and the claim isn’t related to the accident.\\nIf you decide to file an appeal, you can ask your doctor, supplier, or other health care provider for any information that may help your case.

A coverage determination is the first decision your Medicare drug plan (not the pharmacy) makes about your benefits. This can be a decision about if the plan covers your drug, if you met the plan’s requirements to cover the drug, or how much you pay for the drug. You’ll also get a coverage determination decision if you ask your plan to make an exception to its rules to cover your drug. \\n• Ask for an exception if you or your prescriber (your doctor or other health care provider who’s legally allowed to write prescriptions) believe you need a drug that isn’t on your plan’s list of covered drugs ( formulary ). \\n• Ask for an exception if you or your prescriber believe that your plan should waive a coverage rule (like prior authorization).

Log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare.gov  and \\nchoose a primary care doctor who will help manage your health care in an ACO. \\nSharing your health care information with ACOs \\nOne of the most important benefits of an ACO is that your doctors and other providers can communicate and coordinate your care. To help with that, Medicare allows your health care provider’s ACO to ask for certain information about your care. Having Medicare share your data in this way helps make sure all the people involved in your care have access to your health information when they need it to help you. \\nIf you don’t want Medicare to share your health information with your \\ndoctors for care coordination, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) and let the representative know. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Medicare may still share general information to measure provider quality.\\nTo learn more about ACOs, visit Medicare.gov/manage-your-health/\\ncoordinating-your-care/accountable-care-organizations  or call \\n1-800-MEDICARE.\\nElectronic Health Records\\nElectronic health records are a history of your medical conditions, health care, and treatment that your doctor, other health care provider, medical office staff, or hospital keeps on a computer. \\n• They can help lower the chances of medical errors, eliminate duplicate tests, and may improve your overall quality of care. \\n• Your doctor’s electronic health records may be able to link to a hospital, lab, pharmacy, other doctors, or immunization information systems (registries), so the people who care for you can have a more complete picture of your health.

These plans have different rules for receiving care. In a HMO, you must choose from a group of doctors and other health care providers that are selected by the plan. You must get care from these providers unless it’s an emergency or you have a special situation as determined by the plan. In a PPO, you can get care from any doctor in the network. However, you may have lower costs if you choose to get care from a doctor who is in the plan’s preferred provider network. An EPO works like an HMO except that it covers emergency care anywhere in the U.S. A SNP is designed for people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. It offers special rules, lower copayments and deductibles, and drug coverage.",
